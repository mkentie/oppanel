Oppanel pins - (?) means I don't know what it's for:

(OpPanel\FindComPort.cpp) Contains code to open an USB (i.e. Arduino) COM port by device ID. This might be useful for other projects as well. The trick here is that the device is directly opened as a COM port, so there's no (dubious) code that tries to walk COM ports and match them to an Arduino by name or anything like that.
